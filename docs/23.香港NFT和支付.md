    Please be informed that as with all credit/debit card purchases, there are associated fees.

    When purchasing from one of our partners, Simplex’s fee ranges between 3.5% to 5% of the total transaction, usually with a minimum of $10. There might be an additional fee for the specific platform you are using, and it will be somewhere in this range as well.

    If you are purchasing on Simplex.com directly, the fee can range from 13 to 17%. (with a minimum of $10).
